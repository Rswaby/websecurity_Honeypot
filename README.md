# Project 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: 11 hours spent in total

> Objective: Setup a honeypot and intercept some attempted attacks in the wild

I Used Google cloud platform to deploy the MHN Admin Application.
4 honeypots in total were deployed, they were:
* mhn-honeypot-1-dionaea
* mhn-honeypot-2-elastichoney
* mhn-honeypot-3-shockpot
* mhn-honeypot-4-amun
